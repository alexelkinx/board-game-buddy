# Board Game Buddy

## Overview

**Board Game Buddy** is a web application designed to help groups of friends manage their board game collections and lending activities. The application keeps track of board games, users (gamers), and loan statuses. It allows users to:

- Register and manage their accounts.
- Add, edit, and delete their board games.
- View all games available in the system.
- Borrow currently available games (up to 3 at a time).
- Return games they have borrowed.
- View lending and borrowing histories.

The system ensures a gamer cannot borrow more than three games simultaneously, prompting them to return one before borrowing another. It also records the creation and modification timestamps for all data, enabling users to track who borrowed a game and when.
